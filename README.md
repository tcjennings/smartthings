## SmartThings Node Proxy

Node JS proxy service for connecting SmartThings apps and devices via local LAN to anything.  Built the service as I needed to connect to a Russound multi-zone controller/amplifier via RS-232 and this seemed the easiest.  Extended the service to connect to a Honeywell Ademco alarm system via Envisalink TPI all on local LAN.  The service accepts inbound HTTP calls from your SmartThings apps and devices and is setup to support HTTP NOTIFY callbacks to SmartThings.  This allows you to connect apps and devices to things asynchronously and not require refresh or polling from SmartThings to obtain status.  This also allows you to setup local LAN communication between devices and forego the SmartThings cloud service for callbacks using OAUTH.  Plugin support is available, allowing you to extend the functionality of the service.

### Config
```
config.json
{
  "port": 8080,                   // REQUIRED: SmartThings Node Proxy service port
  "authCode": "secret-key"        // REQUIRED: Auth code used to gain access to SmartThings Node Proxy
  "notify": {
    "address": "192.168.2.31",    // OPTIONAL (will be set automatically): See /subscribe route below
    "port": "39500"               // OPTIONAL (will be set automatically): See /subscribe route below
  }
}
```

### Installation
1. Install Node
2. Download smartthings-nodeproxy to local folder
3. Download and install all package dependencies:

  ```
  cd ~/smartthings-nodeproxy
  npm install
  ```
4. Rename `config.json.sample` to `config.json`
  * Set *port*
  * Set *authCode*
5. Create folder `~/smartthings-nodeproxy/plugins`
6. Copy desired plugins in to `plugins` folder
7. Download and install plugin dependencies:

  ```
  npm run install:<plugin>
  ```
8. Start the server:

  ```
  npm run start
  ```
9. Open a browser and test access:

  ```
  http://<proxy-ip>:<port>
  ```

### Usage

#### Routes
```
/
```
Default root which can be used to test if the service is up and running.

```
/subscribe/<host:port>
```
Called by the SmartThings app/device to set the callback/notify host address and port.  This will usually be set to the SmartThings Hub IP and port.  The notify host address and port will be saved to the config file.

#### Plugins
All plugins located in the `./plugins` folder will be automatically loaded by the SmartThings Node Proxy.
* To include a plugin, place it in the `./plugins` folder.
* To exclude a plugin, remove it from the `./plugins` folder.

Configuration data for the plugins is also stored in the `config.json` configuration file.

#### Callback / Notifications
A plugin can post data to the SmartThings Hub asynchronously via an HTTP NOTIFY.  The `notify()` method is exposed to a plugin by the SmartThings Node Proxy, to be used for this purpose.  The plugin can call the `notify()` method to post data back to the SmartThings Hub whenever an update or change of state is required.  It is the responsibility of the corresponding SmartThings app/device to process the notification.

### Generic Plugin
SmartThings Node Proxy sample plugin with corresponding SmartThings SmartApp and DeviceType.  The Generic plugin was built to demonstrate how the system interacts with SmartThings and also provide a template for building new plugins, SmartApps and DeviceTypes that leverage the power of the SmartThings Node Proxy.  The plugin itself, the SmartApp and DeviceType are considered barebones, with minimum functionality so highlight how the the pieces tie together.  The plugin provides the following functionality, showing how the system integrates with SmartThings;

1. Generic Plugin will listen at http://stnp_ip_address:port/plugins/generic/ AND echo back the message
2. Generic SmartApp will route inbound messages to Generic Device AND route outbound messages to SmartThings Node Proxy
3. Generic Device will submit a message to Generic SmartApp (parent app) to send to STNP AND update the tiles with any message received and flip the on/off switch

## SmartThings SmartApps

### Honeywell Security
SmartApp and Devices to support full SmartThings integration with the Honeywell / Ademco Vista 20p alarm panel.  This will allow you to view status of the zones, view the status of the alarm panel and arm/disarm the panel, as well as integrate with the SmartThings Smart Home Monitor.  The SmartApp and Devices communicate with the alarm panel via the SmartThings Node Proxy Envisalink plugin (pictured below).  Make sure that you have the SmartThings Node Proxy and Envisalink plugin installed and working before adding the SmartApp and Devices to SmartThings.

```
SmartThings Hub <-> SmartThings Node Proxy <-> Envisalink plugin <-> Envisalink Vista TPI module <-> Honeywell / Ademco Vista panel
```

#### Installation

##### SmartThings IDE GitHub Integration


If you have not set up the GitHub integration yet or do not know about it, take a look at the SmartThings documentation [here](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/github-integration.html). Note that if you do not have a GitHub account or are not familiar with GitHub, the manual method of installation is recommended.

1. Add a new repository with user `redloro`, repository `smartthings`, and branch `master`. This can be done in either the "My Device Handlers" or "My SmartApps" sections
2. Go to "My Device Handlers". Click "Update from Repo". Select the "smartthings" repository. You should see the device types in the "New (only in GitHub)" section. Check both boxes next to them. Check the "Publish" checkbox in the bottom right hand corner. Click "Execute Update".
3. Go to "My SmartApps". Click "Update from Repo". Select the "smartthings" repository. You should see the SmartApp in the "New (only in GitHub)" section. Check both boxes next to them. Check the "Publish" checkbox in the bottom right hand corner. Click "Execute Update".
4. In your mobile app, tap the "Marketplace" , go to "My Apps" in "SmartApps" tab, set up the "Honeywell Security SmartApp":
  - SmartThings Hub: REQUIRED
  - SmartThings Node Proxy: REQUIRED to connect to the SmartThings Node Proxy
  - Envisalink Vista TPI: OPTIONAL as this can also be set in `config.json`
  - Security Panel: OPTIONAL as this can also be set in `config.json`
  - Smart Home Monitor: OPTIONAL integration with SmartThings Smart Home Monitor
5. Done! *Note that all the zones defined in `config.json` will be loaded 10 seconds after the SmartApp is configured and all the devices should show up under your Things.  If the zones/devices do not show up, simply open the SmartApp again and hit done to force a refresh of the zones/devices.*

In the future, should you wish to update, simply repeat steps 2 and 3. The only difference is you will see the device types/SmartApp show up in the "Obsolete (updated in GitHub)" column instead.

##### Manual Installation
